CODING CHALLENGE FOR PHASE 1
WEEK1: (Due on Saturday: 3rd August, 2024)
Concepts for this week:	(1) Getting user input	 (2) Manipulating strings (a few ways).
TASK
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. Note: for this exercise, the expectation is that you explicitly write out the year (and therefore be out of date the next year).

Extras:
Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)


CODING CHALLENGE FOR PHASE 1
WEEK2: (Due on Saturday: 10th August, 2024)
Concepts for this week:		(1) Modular arithmetic (the modulus operator) (2)Conditionals (if statements) (3)Checking equality.
TASK
(The exercise comes first; with a few extras if you want the extra challenge or want to spend more time. Enjoy!)
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
Extras:
If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.


CODING CHALLENGE FOR PHASE 1
WEEK3: (Due on Saturday: 17th August, 2024)
Concepts for this week:	    (1) Lists (2)More Conditionals (if statements) (3)Comprehensions
TASK
Take a list, say for example this one:
 a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
Extras:
Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
Write this in one line of Python.
Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.


CODING CHALLENGE FOR PHASE 1
WEEK4: (Due on Saturday: 24th August, 2024)
Concepts for this week:	    (1) Lists (2) Conditionals (3)Comprehensions 
				(4) Modulo Arithmetics (5) Random Numbers
TASK 1
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

TASK 2

Take two lists, say for example these two:
 a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
Extras:
Randomly generate two lists to test this
Write this in one line of Python.//


CODING CHALLENGE FOR PHASE 1
WEEK5: (Due on Saturday: 31st August, 2024)
Concepts for this week:	(1) List indexing	 (2) Writing to a file.
TASK1
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

TASK2
Take the code from TASK 1, and instead of printing the results to a screen, write the results to a txt file. In your code, just make up a name for the file you are saving to.
Extras:
Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.


CODING CHALLENGE FOR PHASE 1
WEEK6: (Due on Saturday: 7th September, 2024)
Concepts for this week:	(1) Random selection	 (2) Conditionals.
TASK
Make a single-player vs computer Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them with randomly generated computer plays, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the player wants to start a new game)
Remember the rules:
Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock


CODING CHALLENGE FOR PHASE 1
WEEK7: (Due on Saturday: 14th September, 2024)
Concepts for this week:	(1) Modules	 (2) Random numbers (2) User input.
TASK
Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. 
Extras:
Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.


CODING CHALLENGE FOR PHASE 1
WEEK8: (Due on Saturday: 21st September, 2024)
Concepts for this week:	(1) Functions	 (2) Reusable functions (2) Default arguments.
TASK
Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself).
